In this project I will be creating a full stack login page using MERN stack.

**Day 1:** Today I set up my development environment for both the client and server side. Then I created a basic login form using react. It was not very advanced just a simple form to get data from the user since my goal is to learn backend for now. Then I set up the backend for project. Created a new database for the project and conncected it to my express app. Then tested my routes for a smooth eperience in future.


**Day 2:** Today I completed the login page, i defined the functionality for registration,logging in and connected the frontend and backend.

- Added encryption on password (using bcrypt)
- Added response messages using react toastr
- Done with the jwt part
- Made a dashboard to display the name of the logged in user
