In this project I will be creating a full stack login page using MERN stack.

**Day 1:** Today I set up my development environment for both the client and server side. Then I created a basic login form using react. It was not very advanced just a simple form to get data from the user since my goal is to learn backend for now. Then I set up the backend for project. Created a new database for the project and conncected it to my express app. Then tested my routes for a smooth eperience in future.
